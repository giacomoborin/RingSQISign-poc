# RingSQISign-SageMath

A SageMath implementation of Ring Signatures based on SQISign. The project is a fork. 
Also it contains a distinguisher that is capable of understanding if an isogeny has been generated by SigningKLPT or not, given the connecting ideal used for the procedure. 

## Project Overview

SQISign itself is implemented in the file [`SQISign.py`](SQISign.py). Reading this code is enough to see
a high-level description of how the main functions: `keygen()`, `commitment()`, `challenge()`, `response()`
and `verify_response()` have been implemented.

If you wish to run SQISign yourself, we include two examples following the above snippets with additional comments:

- [`example_SQISign.sage`](example_SQISign.sage)
- [`example_signing.sage`](example_signing.sage)
